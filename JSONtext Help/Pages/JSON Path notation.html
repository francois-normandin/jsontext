<h2>JSON Path notation in JSONtext</h2>
<p>Paths specify an item in a tree of nested Elements, and start with $. Each element is either in the form .name, for Object items, or [n] for Array index ([*] for all elements). Multiple Object items can be specified by the list form .[abc,def].</p>
<p>If the Path input does not start with a $, then it is interpreted as a single Object Item name, rather than a path.</p>
<p>Example JSON:</p>
<p>{"A":[{"C":123,"D":4},{"C":567,"D":8}],"B":{"F":9},"E":true}</p>
<p>At path $.A[*].C are 123 and 567</p>
<p>At path $.B (or just B) is {"F":9}</p>
<p>At path $.B.F is 9</p>
<p>At path $.[B,E] are {"F":9} and true</p>
<p>Object items can also be specified as their proper JSON string.&nbsp; &nbsp;This allows the use of characters in names that would otherwise not parse correctly.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>$."My Name that contains \"quotes\", []brackets, and dots."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that this must be proper JSON (thus the escaped quotes in the example).</p>
