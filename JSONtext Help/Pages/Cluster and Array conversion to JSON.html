<h2>Cluster conversion to/from JSON Objects or Arrays</h2>
<p>LabVIEW clusters are ordered lists of named or unnamed elements (of mixed datatype). &nbsp; JSON Arrays are ordered lists of unnamed items, while JSON Objects are unordered collections of uniquely-named items. &nbsp;Thus, it is not a one-to-one mapping between a LabVIEW cluster and JSON types.</p>
<p>JSONtext, when converting a cluster to JSON, follows the following convention, based on the name of the first cluster element:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the first element is unnamed (or has the exact name <a href="JSON%20tags.html">&lt;JSON&gt;</a>), then the cluster is converted to a JSON Array.</li>
<li>If the first element is named then the cluster is converted to a JSON Object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the first cluster element is used to make this decision. &nbsp;If converted to a JSON Array, then any names of elements are ignored. If converted to a Object, then unnamed elements will have an empty name (""). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Clusters must have unique names in order to produce a valid JSON Object.</p>
<h2>Array conversion</h2>
<p>LabVIEW arrays are ordered lists of a sigle datatype. &nbsp; They can be converted to/from JSON Arrays of all one type. &nbsp; To handle mixed-type JSON Arrays use a cluster with unnamed elements&nbsp;(can have&nbsp;<a href="JSON%20tags.html">&lt;JSON&gt; tags</a>), as described above.</p>
